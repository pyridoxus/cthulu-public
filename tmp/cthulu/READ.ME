CTHULU ICON FILES
------------------------------------------

These files are supposed to be placed at:

/tmp/cthulu

when being used. The files exist here so
that they can be tracked with GIT.

Please be sure to:

cd [$WORKSPACE]/cthulu/tmp
cp -Rf cthulu /tmp

...when you make any changes to this
directory while developing.

In the near future, all of these files
will be version controlled with the
database, which will make this procedure
obsolete.
